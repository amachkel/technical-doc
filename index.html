            <p>Our starting point is an HTML document. You can copy the code from below if you want to work on your own
                computer. Save the code below as index.html in a folder on your machine.</p>

            <pre>
                    <code>
                &lt;!doctype html&gt;
                &lt;html lang="en"&gt;

                &lt;head&gt;

                    &lt;title&gt;Getting started with CSS&lt;/title&gt;
                &lt;/head&gt;

                &lt;body&gt;

                    &lt;h1&gt;I am a level one heading&lt;/h1&gt;

                    &lt;p&gt;This is a paragraph of text. In the text is a &lt;span>span element&lt;/span&gt;
                    and also a &lt; href="https://example.com"&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

                    &lt;p&gt;This is the second paragraph. It contains an &lt;em&gt;emphasized&lt;/em&gt;
                    element.&lt;/p&gt;

                    &lt;ul&gt;

                        &lt;li&gt;Item two&lt;/li&gt;
                        &lt;li&gt;Item &lt;em&gt;three&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
                    &lt;/ul&gt;

                &lt;/body&gt;

        <section class="main-section" id="Adding_CSS_to_our_document">
            <header>Adding CSS to our document</header>
            <p>
                The very first thing we need to do is to tell the HTML document that we have some CSS rules we want it
                to
                use. There are three different ways to apply CSS to an HTML document that you'll commonly come across,
                however, for now, we will look at the most usual and useful way of doing so — linking CSS from the head
                of
                your document.</p>

            <p>Create a file in the same folder as your HTML document and save it as styles.css. The .css extension
                shows
                that this is a CSS file.</p>

            <p>To link styles.css to index.html add the following line somewhere inside the

                &lt;head&gt; of the HTML document:</p>

            <pre>
                    <code>
                        &lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css"&gt;
                        </code>
                    </pre>

            <p>
                This
                &lt;link&gt; element tells the browser that we have a stylesheet, using the rel attribute, and the
                location of
                that stylesheet as the value of the href attribute. You can test that the CSS works by adding a rule to
                styles.css. Using your code editor add the following to your CSS file:
            </p>

            <pre>
                    <code>
                        h1 {
                        color: red;
                        }
                        </code>
                    </pre>


            <p>
                Save your HTML and CSS files and reload the page in a web browser. The level one heading at the top of
                the document should now be red. If that happens, congratulations — you have successfully applied some
                CSS to an HTML document. If that doesn't happen, carefully check that you've typed everything correctly.
            </p>
            <p>
                You can continue to work in styles.css locally, or you can use our interactive editor below to continue
                with this tutorial. The interactive editor acts as if the CSS in the first panel is linked to the HTML
                document, just as we have with our document above.
            </p>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Styling_HTML_elements">
            <header>Styling HTML elements</header>
            <p>
                By making our heading red we have already demonstrated that we can target and style an HTML element. We
                do this by targeting an element selector — this is a selector that directly matches an HTML element
                name. To target all paragraphs in the document you would use the selector p. To turn all paragraphs
                green you would use:
            </p>
            <pre>
                <code>
                    p {
                    color: green;
                    }
                </code>
            </pre>
            <p>
                You can target multiple selectors at once, by separating the selectors with a comma. If I want all
                paragraphs and all list items to be green my rule looks like this:
            </p>
            <pre>
                <code>
                    p, li {
                    color: green;
                    }
                </code>
            </pre>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Changing_the_default_behavior_of_elements">
            <header>Changing the default behavior of elements</header>
            <p>
                When we look at a well-marked up HTML document, even something as simple as our example, we can see how
                the browser
                is making the HTML readable by adding some default styling. Headings are large and bold and our list has
                bullets.
                This happens because browsers have internal stylesheets containing default styles, which they apply to
                all pages by
                default; without them all of the text would run together in a clump and we would have to style
                everything from
                scratch. All modern browsers display HTML content by default in pretty much the same way.
            </p>
            <p>
                However, you will often want something other than the choice the browser has made. This can be done by
                choosing the
                HTML element that you want to change, and using a CSS rule to change the way it looks. A good example is
                our &lt;ul&gt;,
                an unordered list. It has list bullets, and if I decide I don't want those bullets I can remove them
                like so:
            </p>
            <pre>
    <code>
        li {
        list-style-type: none;
        }
    </code>
</pre>
            <p>
                The list-style-type property is a good property to look at on MDN to see which values are supported.
                Take a look at
                the page for list-style-type and you will find an interactive example at the top of the page to try some
                different
                values in, then all allowable values are detailed further down the page.
            </p>
            <p>
                Looking at that page you will discover that in addition to removing the list bullets you can change them
                — try changing them to square bullets by using a value of square.
            </p>

            <section class="main-section" id="Adding_a_class">
                <header>Adding a class</header>
                <p>
                    So far we have styled elements based on their HTML element names. This works as long as you want all
                    of the elements of that type in your document to look the same. Most of the time that isn't the case
                    and so you will need to find a way to select a subset of the elements without changing the others.
                    The most common way to do this is to add a class to your HTML element and target that class.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In your HTML document, add a class attribute to the second list item. Your list will now look like
                    this:
                </p>
                <pre>
                    <code>
                        &lt;ul&gt;
                            &lt;li>Item one&lt;/li&gt;
                            &lt;li class="special"&gt;Item two&lt;/li&gt;
                            &lt;li&gt;Item &lt;em&gt;three&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
                        &lt;/ul&gt;
                    </code>
                </pre>
                <p>
                    In your CSS you can target the class of special by creating a selector that starts with a full stop
                    character. Add the following to your CSS file:
                </p>
                <pre>
                    <code>
                        .special {
                        color: orange;
                        font-weight: bold;
                        }
                    </code>
                </pre>
                <p>
                    Save and refresh to see what the result is.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You can apply the class of special to any element on your page that you want to have the same look
                    as this list item. For example, you might want the <span> in the paragraph to also be orange and
                        bold. Try adding a class of special to it, then reload your page and see what happens.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Sometimes you will see rules with a selector that lists the HTML element selector along with the
                    class:
                </p>
                <pre>
                    <code>
                        li.special {
                        color: orange;
                        font-weight: bold;
                        }
                    </code>
                </pre>
                <p>
                    This syntax means "target any li element that has a class of special". If you were to do this then
                    you would no longer be able to apply the class to a &lt;span&gt; or another element by adding the
                    class to
                    it; you would have to add that element to the list of selectors:
                </p>
                <pre>
                    <code>
                        li.special,
                        span.special {
                        color: orange;
                        font-weight: bold;
                        }
                    </code>
                </pre>
                <p>
                    As you can imagine, some classes might be applied to many elements and you don't want to have to
                    keep editing your CSS every time something new needs to take on that style. Therefore it is
                    sometimes best to bypass the element and refer to the class, unless you know that you want to create
                    some special rules for one element alone, and perhaps want to make sure they are not applied to
                    other things.
